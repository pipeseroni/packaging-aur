# packaging-aur

This repository hosts Arch Linux `PKGBUILD` files of Pipeseroni pipes for [Arch User Repository][AUR], each is under their own branch with the same name as the pipe's:

Pipes                    | Branches
------------------------ | -------------------------
[`pipes.c`][pipes.c]     | [`pipes.c`][branch-c]
[`pipes.sh`][pipes.sh]   | [`pipes.sh`][branch-sh]

[AUR]: https://aur.archlinux.org/
[pipes.c]: https://github.com/pipeseroni/pipes.c
[pipes.sh]: https://github.com/pipeseroni/pipes.sh
[branch-c]: https://github.com/pipeseroni/packaging-aur/tree/pipes.c
[branch-sh]: https://github.com/pipeseroni/packaging-aur/tree/pipes.sh

## Packaging

After a new release is made of a Pipeseroni project, the following fields need
to be updated:

* `pkgver` in `PKGBUILD`.
* `sha256sums` in `PKGBUILD` and `.SRCINFO`.

### Automated packaging

The entire packaging process can be automated with [scripts/autoupdate], which
will iterate over each branch in this repository and fetch release information
for that project from GitHub's API. For branches with new releases, the script
will bump `pkgver` and `sha256sums`, interactively commit, and prompt to push
changes to the AUR.

The autoupdate script requires that [`jq`][jq] be installed. It also requires
`wget` and `bash`.

### Git hooks

It is recommended that you install [hooks/pre-commit] as a pre-commit hook (`cp
hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks`). This will automatically update `.SRCINFO` before
any commits, and will abort commits if the `sha256sums` in `PKGBUILD` do not
match the actual checksums. If this hook is installed, you simply need to edit
`pkgver`, run `updpkgsums` to update the checksums, and commit `PKGBUILD`.

It is also recommended that you install [hooks/pre-push]. This hook will
prevent any pushes from branch names that do not match the remote name. This
will help avoid confusion arising from typos by print an error message when,
for example, trying to push to the `pipes.sh` remote when on the `pipes.c`
branch. It will also check that the `.SRCINFO` being pushed exactly matches
an autogenerated `.SRCINFO`.

Both hooks require `bash`.
